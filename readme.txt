Style your login page differently.

== Description ==

If you are working for a customer or you just want to set a page for a community (band, choir etc.) they might appreciate their own logo at the login screen. With this plugin, you can even go further and style your whole login page according to your needs. At the moment, there is only the way for 'dummies' to style the page, but in a future version you will be able to enter some css code yourself and the final goal is, also to offer the possibility to copy an entire stylesheet into the plugin, to have the most freedom of styling and changing the items on your loginscreen. Since version 1.7 the A5 Custom Login Page is also for a WP networksetup.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `custom-login-page` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Settings' and style your login page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

None so far.

== Future Versions ==

We are planning some more advanced features in the future such as

* freedom to enter your own pieces of css instead of using the plugin's interface

* possibility to just copy paste your entire stylesheet

== Screenshots ==

1. The options page of the plugin
